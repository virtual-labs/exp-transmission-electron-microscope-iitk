#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|Students play with the controller and understand the function of the instrument | 1 Simulator enables the virtual operation of the TEM instrument| 1 Learning about the operation of the instrument
2.| Students will acquire bright field image |2 Simulator will enable the students to play with the virtual controllers and understand its operation. | 2 Learning about the imaging in TEM
3.| Students acquire diffraction pattern |3 Simulator will guide the students about the steps to be followed | 3 Learning about Diffraction Pattern in TEM.
